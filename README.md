## SQL Queries
``` SQL
/* Query 1: What SQL query will produce the row of customer 
information who have made three or more successful orders 
from this shop? */
select c.* from customers c, orders o
where c.cid = o.cid
group by o.cid
having count(o.oid) >= 3;

/* Query 2: What SQL query will produce the row of customer 
information who have spent $500 or more in total in this 
shop? */
select c.* from customers c, orders o, invoices i, products p 
where c.cid = o.cid and o.oid = i.oid and i.pid = p.pid 
group by c.cid 
having sum(i.quantity*p.price)>=500;

/* Query 3: What SQL query will list the product information 
where no customers bought this product before? */
select * from products p
where p.pid not in 
(select i.pid from invoices i);

/* Query 4: What SQL query will list the product information 
where only one customer bought this product before? */
select p.* from customers c, orders o, invoices i, products p 
where c.cid = o.cid and o.oid = i.oid and i.pid = p.pid 
group by p.pid 
having count(c.cid)=1;

/* Query 5: What SQL query will list the total number of 
customer orders per product in the database? */
select p.pid, count(o.oid) 
from orders o join invoices i on (o.oid = i.oid)
right join products p on (i.pid = p.pid) 
group by p.pid;

/* Query 6: What SQL Query will produce the total amount of 
the sold products in the database? */
select sum(quantity) from invoices;


/* Query 7: Write a function CostOfBestBuyers(number INT) 
Return Double that returns the total price of the top number 
of customers who spent in this shop. For instance, if number 
=5, the returned price is the total cost of the 5 customers 
who spent the most in this shop. */

) as s into total;
return total;
end++
delimiter ;

/* Query 8: Create a view BuyerCostPerProduct with columns 
Customer ID, Customer Name, Product ID, Product Name, Date 
which provides a more accessible way for the DB user to run 
queries regarding customers and products. The date is the 
time to produce the view. In other words, the virtual table 
view maintains each buyerâ€™s cost for each product by a view 
generation date. */
